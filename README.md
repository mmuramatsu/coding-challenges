## 🌟 Overview

This repository serves as a centralized collection of my solutions to various LeetCode/HackerRank problems. The primary goal is to:

* **Document Learning:** Keep a structured record of my approach to different algorithmic problems.

* **Track Progress:** Monitor my improvement in data structures and algorithms.

* **Reference:** Provide a quick reference for common patterns and solutions.

* **Review:** Facilitate easy review of past solutions for revision and optimization.

Each solution typically includes:

* My solution code.

* Brief explanations of the approach, time complexity, and space complexity.

* Test cases (if applicable or custom ones).

**Node:** Not all solutions have an explanation in the code. I started adding them to make it easier to understand the solution when revisited and also to improve my general understanding of the problem. Example of solutions with explanations: [3307 - Find the K-th Character in String Game II (HARD)](/LeetCode/Hard/3307-Find_The_K-th_Character_In_String_Game_II/3307-FindTheK-thCharacterInStringGameII.md)

## 📂 Repository Structure

Solutions are organized primarily by **platform name** and then by **difficulty level** and finally by **problem ID** (or a descriptive name). This structure aims for clarity and ease of navigation.

* **`PlatformName/`**: (e.g., LeetCode/, HackerRank/) - Top-level directories categorizing problems by their source platform.

* **`DifficultyLevel/`**: (e.g., `Easy/`, `Medium/`, `Hard/`) - Top-level directories categorizing problems by their LeetCode difficulty.

* **`ProblemName/`**: (e.g., `1 - TwoSum/`, `51 - N-Queens/`) - Subdirectories for each individual problem, named descriptively.

* **`ProblemName.ext`**: The actual solution file(s) in the respective programming language(s).

### Navigating Solutions

You can browse the solutions directly on GitHub or by navigating the cloned repository on your local machine. Solutions are organized by difficulty and problem name.

**Note:** Most solutions are written as functions intended to be called with specific inputs. You might need to add a `main` function or equivalent entry point in the solution file to test it directly from the command line.

## 🛠 Languages Used

The solutions are primarily implemented using the following programming languages:

* **Python**

* **C++**

* **JavaScript**

* **Elixir**

**Note:** Not all problems have solutions in C++, JavaScript or Elxir, but I guarantee that all solutions have a Python version.

## 📈 Progress & Statistics

I track my coding challenge progress using various metrics. Future plans include incorporating badges or a generated table to visualize:

* Total problems solved across all platforms.

* Number of problems solved per platform.

* Number of problems solved per difficulty (Easy, Medium, Hard) on platforms that use them.

* Solutions per language.

## 🤝 Contribution

This repository is primarily for my personal learning and progress tracking. However, if you find any issues, errors, or have suggestions for improvements (e.g., more optimal solutions, better explanations), feel free to:

1. **Open an Issue:** Describe the bug or suggestion.

2. **Submit a Pull Request:** If you have a fix or an alternative solution. Please ensure your code adheres to the existing structure and includes clear comments.
